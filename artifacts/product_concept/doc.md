    - `Step 2: Client inputs project requirements using natural language descriptions, uploads reference images, and/or selects reference talent profiles.`
    - `Step 3: AI-powered search engine processes various inputs and presents a curated list of matching talent.`
    - `Step 4: Client browses detailed (but privacy-controlled) talent profiles and creates their own preliminary shortlists.`
    - `Step 5: Client submits their shortlist or inquiry to the agency's Talent Booker for official engagement.`

- **Journey 5: Client - Data-Driven Talent Exploration (Limited)**
  - `User Goal`: To explore talent options and receive data-driven suggestions
    within a controlled environment.
  - `Steps`:
    - `Step 1: Client accesses the secure talent discovery portal.`
    - `Step 2: Client inputs project requirements and explores talent, similar to previous client journey.`
    - `Step 3: Platform provides limited, curated data-driven suggestions (e.g., "Talent similar to this profile," "Trends in requested attributes").`
    - `Step 4: Client reviews data insights to inform their preliminary talent selection and project vision.`
    - `Step 5: Client shares refined interests or submits inquiry to their assigned Talent Booker.`

### 2.3 Key Features & Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

- **MVP Definition:** The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on delivering
  a foundational AI-powered platform that addresses the core inefficiencies in
  talent acquisition and matching for modeling agencies. It will enable
  streamlined digital applications, intelligent talent searching and
  shortlisting for internal users, and basic intuitive talent discovery for
  external clients, ensuring immediate value delivery and validating the core AI
  capabilities.

- **MVP Features:**

      **Core Platform & Talent Management:**
      -   **Streamlined Digital Talent Application:** Automated intake of new talent applications with guided data input and media upload.
          -   *Contribution to MVP*: Addresses core problem of inefficient talent acquisition, expands talent pool.
      -   **AI-Enhanced Talent Profile Management:** Centralized, searchable talent database with capabilities for automated data validation and intelligent suggestions for profile enrichment.
          -   *Contribution to MVP*: Improves data consistency and searchability, reduces manual overhead for Talent Operations Specialists.

      **Talent Matching & Discovery:**
      -   **Internal AI Talent Search & Shortlisting (for Talent Bookers):** Advanced search functionality including natural language querying, reference image/profile matching, and data-driven suggestions for Talent Bookers.

  This includes access to internal operational state trends and comprehensive
  talent analytics. - _Contribution to MVP_: Direct solution to inefficient and
  subjective matching, empowers bookers with insights. - **Client-Facing
  Intuitive Talent Discovery (Free & Limited):** A secure portal for clients to
  intuitively search and explore talent profiles using natural language
  descriptions, reference images, and reference talent. This will be free but
  with inherent limitations (e.g., number of searches, depth of results,
  specific features restricted). - _Contribution to MVP_: Enhances client
  experience, increases client engagement, and supports core value proposition
  of improved matching without immediate monetization complexity.

- **Out-of-Scope for MVP (but potential future features):** - **Full
  Self-Service Client Booking:** Direct booking/contracting functionality for
  clients without agent intermediation. - _Rationale_: High complexity, requires
  robust legal and financial integration; not critical for initial value
  validation. - **Advanced Predictive Analytics for Market Trends:** Deep
  learning models for forecasting talent demand or market shifts beyond
  immediate operational trends. - _Rationale_: Requires significant data volume
  and model maturity; focus MVP on immediate operational insights. - **Talent
  Payment & Invoicing Integration:** Direct integration with financial systems
  for talent payments and client invoicing. - _Rationale_: Highly complex
  financial integration; not directly tied to core problem of
  acquisition/matching. - **Model Booking Management & Contract Document
  Management:** Features for tracking booking status, schedules, generating
  contracts, and managing booking-related documents. - _Rationale_: While
  valuable for operational efficiency, these are standard CRUD operations that
  can be implemented after establishing the core AI infrastructure. MVP focuses
  on validating AI-powered acquisition and matching capabilities first. - **AI
  Feature Monetization & Credit/Usage Tracking:** A system to track AI-powered
  search usage for billing or credit allocation purposes, or to gate advanced
  features behind payment. - _Rationale_: The initial client-facing discovery
  will be free and limited to prove value. Monetization strategies and the
  technical implementation of credit/usage tracking can be developed and
  integrated in a post-MVP phase. - **Fully Automated Client-Facing Platform for
  Talent:** A platform that allows clients to autonomously manage the entire
  talent engagement process, including automated contracting, direct scheduling,
  and payment processing without agency intermediation. - _Rationale_: Such a
  platform implies a significant shift in business model and requires extensive
  integration, legal frameworks, and trust building. The MVP focuses on
  enhancing agency-led processes and initial client discovery, not
  disintermediation.
