# Product Design System Document: High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions

---

## Component Overview

This document outlines the **High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions** component of our Product Design System. It defines the overall technical blueprint for the solution, translating product concepts into a strategic technical approach.

### Purpose of this Component (`technical_design.md`)

This file provides the **template and guidelines** for the AI Agent to define the **system architecture, chosen technologies, non-functional requirements, and key architectural decisions** for an initiative. It acts as the blueprint for creating the corresponding artifact in the `artifacts/technical_design/` directory.

### How this Component Fits in the Workflow

- **Upstream Dependencies:** This component **directly builds upon the `Product Concept & Core Requirements`** artifact. The technical design must enable the solution vision, core user journeys, and MVP scope defined upstream. It also implicitly draws from the `Problem & Opportunity Definition`.
- **Downstream Impact:** This component establishes the foundation for all subsequent technical work. It directly informs:
  - `Technical Planning (Component Level)`: For detailed design of individual technical components.
  - `Product Feature Specifications`: To ensure technical feasibility and guide implementation details.
  - `Task Scoping & Construction`: For defining engineering tasks.

## Guidance for AI Agent: High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions (The "HOW-TO")

This section provides specific instructions and methodologies for the AI Agent when assisting in the creation of the High-Level Technical Design artifact. The agent MUST strictly adhere to these guidelines, applying its core operational rules (defined in `docs/pm/index.md`) contextually here.

### Agent & Human Collaboration Behavior for High-Level Technical Design

- **Principle:** The agent should guide the human user (potentially a technical lead) through a structured process of outlining the technical solution, ensuring alignment with product goals, while facilitating strategic architectural decisions and considering non-functional requirements.
- **Sequential Progression & Confirmation:**
  - The definition process should generally follow the artifact sections sequentially.
  - The **Agent MUST obtain explicit human confirmation** after sufficient clarity and content are achieved for each major section before proceeding.
- **Proactive Contribution (Challenge & Suggestion):**
  - The agent is empowered to **proactively challenge** technical approaches that seem to contradict the product concept, violate non-functional requirements, or introduce undue complexity/risk. Challenges must be accompanied by a clear _rationale_.
  - The agent **MAY proactively suggest** common architectural patterns, technology choices, or alternative design considerations based on best practices and potential implications for scalability, security, or maintenance. **Crucially, these suggestions should be research-based,
    derived from an assumed ability to access and interpret current technical
    knowledge, best practices, and industry trends (as if using research
    tools/knowledge bases).** Suggestions must be presented with their rationale
    and potential benefit.
- **Flagging for Human Review (Escalation):** The agent **MUST flag for explicit human review** (as per the Critical Review Flagging directive in its core prompt) if:
  - Significant architectural decisions require deep human expertise in specific domains or technologies beyond the scope of general technical knowledge.
  - Contradictions arise between proposed technical design and product requirements that cannot be resolved through iterative refinement.
  - Unacceptable risks (e.g., security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks) are identified that lack clear mitigation strategies.

### Specific Agent Elicitation Techniques & Frameworks for High-Level Technical Design

This section details the methodologies to be applied by the AI agent for structured elicitation to populate each section of the artifact.

## Validation Strategy for this Component (for AI Agent)

As the AI Agent, before marking this component's artifact as complete, you must perform the following validation checks:

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Confirm all sections and their sub-components are fully populated.
  - Verify that no bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) remain in the generated artifact.
- **Consistency & Cohesion Check (with Upstream):**
  - **Concept-Design Alignment:** Ensure the technical design directly enables the solution vision, user journeys, and MVP scope defined in the upstream `Product Concept & Core Requirements` artifact.
  - **Problem-Design Alignment:** Verify that core technical decisions indirectly (via product concept) support addressing the original problem defined upstream.
- **Logical Flow Check:**
  - Read through the entire generated artifact to ensure a coherent narrative from high-level architecture down to key decisions and non-functional requirements.
- **Proactive Challenge on Inconsistency:** If any ambiguities or inconsistencies are detected during validation that cannot be resolved automatically, the agent MUST proactively challenge the user/data, provide rationale, and if unresolved, **flag the artifact for human review** with specific observations and suggested questions.

### 3.1 Architectural Overview

- **Purpose:** To provide a high-level conceptual view of the system's architecture, its major components, their interactions, and the underlying technical stack.
- **Content:**
  - **System Context:**
    The AI-Powered Talent Agency Platform is a unified web application designed to streamline modeling agency operations by automating talent acquisition and optimizing talent-to-client matching. It is built using Next.js for both frontend and API backend, deployed on Vercel, and leverages Supabase as its comprehensive backend-as-a-service provider for data, authentication, storage, and serverless functions.

    **System Boundaries:**
    *   **Next.js Application:** This is the core of our system, hosting all user interfaces (frontend) and handling API endpoints/business logic (backend via API Routes).
    *   **Supabase Platform:** This acts as our managed backend, providing the PostgreSQL database (including `pgvector`), authentication, file storage, and serverless "Edge Functions" (which can be used for async tasks or specialized API logic).
    *   **External Users:** Prospective talent (applicants), existing talent roster, clients (brands/casting directors), and internal agency staff (Scouts, Bookers, etc.).

    **External System Interactions:**
    *   **External Large Language Model (LLM) Service:** An external API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) called by our Next.js backend for data enrichment and intelligent features.
    *   **External Notification Service:** An API for sending emails or other notifications, called by our Next.js backend or Supabase Edge Functions.
    *   **External Legal Contract Generation Service:** (Post-MVP) A third-party service for contract management.
    *   **Vercel Deployment Platform:** Hosts and delivers the Next.js application.

    **Key System Boundaries:**
    *   **Inside:** All Next.js code (frontend and API Routes), all Supabase schema, data, and Edge Functions.
    *   **Outside:** The LLM API, the notification service API, the legal contract generation service, and the underlying cloud infrastructure managed by Supabase and Vercel.

  - **Overall Technical Stack:**
    *   **Frontend & Backend Framework:** Next.js (with React and TypeScript)
    *   **Deployment Platform:** Vercel
    *   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase (for PostgreSQL Database, `pgvector` Vector DB, Authentication, Storage, Edge Functions)
    *   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (for type-safe database interactions)
    *   **LLM Orchestration:** LangChain or LlamaIndex (to be decided in Technical Planning, but to be integrated within Next.js API Routes)
    *   **LLM Provider:** Specific provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to be chosen during implementation based on capability and cost.

  - **Major System Components (Deployment View):**
    *   **Web Application (Next.js App on Vercel):**
        *   The unified frontend (UI/UX) and backend (API Routes) deployed as serverless functions.
        *   Handles all client-facing interactions and primary business logic execution.
    *   **Managed Backend Services (Supabase):**
        *   Comprises the PostgreSQL database, Authentication service, File Storage, and Edge Functions.
        *   Serves as the primary data store and provides essential backend utilities.
    *   **External Specialized Services:**
        *   Large Language Model (LLM) service for AI capabilities.
        *   Notification Service for communications.
        *   (Optional) Legal Contract Generation Service for specialized document generation.

  - **High-Level Interactions:**
    The system operates with the Next.js Web Application as the central orchestrator of user and data flows.
    *   **User Interaction:** Users interact directly with the Web Application (frontend).
    *   **Application Logic & Data Access:** The Web Application's API Routes handle business logic and directly interact with Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage) via its client libraries.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks (e.g., AI embedding generation, complex data enrichment) are handled by dedicated Next.js API Routes, potentially offloading heavy computation. Supabase Edge Functions may be triggered for specific database-related background tasks (e.g., database webhooks).
    *   **AI Integration:** The Web Application's API Routes call the External LLM Service for AI processing (e.g., natural language understanding, vector generation).
    *   **Notifications:** The Web Application's API Routes trigger the External Notification Service for user communications.

### 3.2 Key Architectural Decisions

- **Purpose:** To document significant technical decisions, along with their
  rationale, implications, and alternatives considered.
- **Content:**
  - **Decision 1: Unified Next.js Application for Frontend and Backend (API Routes)**
    - `Decision`: The application will be built as a single Next.js project utilizing its capabilities for both frontend (React) and backend (API Routes).
    - `Rationale`:
      - **Developer Velocity:** Enables rapid development cycle due to co-location of related code, unified dependency management, and a single deployment pipeline.
      - **Code Reusability:** Facilitates sharing of code (e.g., types, validation schemas, utility functions) between frontend and backend, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.
      - **Language Consistency:** Both frontend and backend are written in TypeScript, providing type safety and a consistent development experience across the stack.
      - **Simplified Deployment:** Leverages Vercel's optimized platform for deploying Next.js applications as serverless functions, streamlining infrastructure management.
    - `Alternatives Considered`:
      - Separate frontend (React app) and backend (e.g., Node.js Express/Python FastAPI on a separate server): Offers clearer separation of concerns but increases development/deployment overhead and reduces potential for code reuse.
    - `Implications`:
      - **Performance Monitoring:** Requires careful monitoring of Next.js API route performance, especially for long-running or resource-intensive tasks, to avoid timeout issues inherent in serverless functions.
      - **Monolithic Tendencies:** Can lead to a tightly coupled codebase if not structured properly (e.g., with clear domain boundaries, clean architecture principles).

  - **Decision 2: Supabase as Comprehensive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**
    - `Decision`: Supabase will be used for PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and `pgvector` for vector database capabilities.
    - `Rationale`:
      - **Offloading Operational Burden:** Shifts database, auth, and storage infrastructure management to a managed service, allowing the team to focus on core product logic.
      - **Integrated Ecosystem:** Provides a cohesive suite of services (DB, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime) that work seamlessly together, simplifying development.
      - **Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability:** Offers a scalable, pay-as-you-go model that is cost-effective from inception through growth, especially for initial phases.
      - **PostgreSQL Native:** Utilizes PostgreSQL, a robust and feature-rich relational database, which also supports vector embeddings via `pgvector`.
    - `Alternatives Considered`:
      - Separate managed services for each component (e.g., Auth0 for auth, AWS S3 for storage, a different managed PostgreSQL like Neon/RDS): Offers more vendor flexibility but increases integration complexity and management overhead.
    - `Implications`:
      - **Vendor Lock-in:** While PostgreSQL is open-source, features like Row Level Security, Realtime, and specific Supabase APIs create some level of dependency on the platform.
      - **Abstraction Layer Needed:** Requires deliberate architectural decisions (e.g., using Drizzle ORM, implementing repositories) to abstract direct Supabase client dependencies for easier migration in the future if needed.

  - **Decision 3: LangChain/LangGraph and Vercel AI SDK for AI Orchestration**
    - `Decision`: LangChain/LangGraph will be the primary libraries for complex AI orchestration and agentic workflows, complemented by Vercel AI SDK for simpler AI integrations.
    - `Rationale`:
      - **Full Control & Flexibility:** LangChain/LangGraph provides a robust framework for building complex LLM applications, allowing fine-grained control over prompt engineering, chaining, agents, and custom tools.
      - **Core to Product:** AI features are central to the platform's value proposition (e.g., talent matching, enrichment), requiring a powerful and flexible orchestration layer.
      - **Observability & Optimization:** Integration with LangSmith enables critical capabilities for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing LLM calls, prompts, and agent behavior, facilitating prompt validation and feedback loops.
      - **Simplicity for Basic Use Cases:** Vercel AI SDK offers a streamlined interface for common LLM interactions (e.g., chat, simple text generation), suitable for quick integrations where less orchestration is needed.
    - `Alternatives Considered`:
      - Native API calls to LLM providers (without a framework): Offers maximum control but requires building all orchestration logic from scratch, increasing development time and complexity.
      - Other AI orchestration frameworks: LangChain is a current leader with strong community support and features.
    - `Implications`:
      - **Learning Curve:** LangChain/LangGraph has a learning curve due to its extensive features and abstractions.
      - **Dependency on Framework:** Application logic will be tightly coupled to the chosen AI orchestration framework.
      - **Cost Management:** Requires careful monitoring of LLM token usage and API calls through LangSmith (or other means) to manage operational costs.

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Purpose:** To define the quality attributes and constraints that the system
  must meet, crucial for successful delivery but not directly related to core
  functionality.
- **Content:**
  - **Performance:**
    - User-facing API responses (e.g., login, talent profile views, CRUD operations) must be returned within **205ms** for 90% of requests under typical load.
    - **AI-powered search requests** (e.g., natural language talent search, image similarity search) should return results within **750ms** for 90% of requests under typical load. (This accounts for LLM calls and vector database latency.)
    - Background data processing (e.g., vector embedding generation for new talent applications) should ensure that new or updated talent profiles are fully searchable within **1 hour** of submission.
  - **Scalability:**
    - The system must support an initial target of **500 concurrent active users** without significant performance degradation.
    - The platform should be architected to horizontally scale to support **5x user growth** within a 12-month period with minimal architectural changes.
    - Supabase resources (DB, Auth, Storage) should be configured to automatically scale with demand.
  - **Security:**
    - All sensitive data (e.g., personal talent information, client project details) must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
    - The application must adhere to **OWASP Top 10** security principles in its design and implementation.
    - Robust authentication and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** must be enforced across all modules for internal agency staff and external clients/talent.
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted.
  - **Reliability/Availability:**
    - The core application (Web Application on Vercel and Supabase services) must achieve **99.9% uptime** (excluding planned maintenance). This translates to no more than ~8.76 hours of downtime per year.
    - Data backups for Supabase must be performed **daily** with a retention period of at least **30 days**.
    - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for data loss in case of disaster: **< 4 hours**.
    - Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for core services in case of disaster: **< 8 hours**.
  - **Maintainability:**
    - The codebase must follow **clean architecture principles** and be well-documented (e.g., READMEs, inline comments, architecture decision records).
    - New features of moderate complexity should be implementable within **2 weeks** by a typical developer who is onboarded to the system.
    - Automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) coverage goals to be defined during Technical Planning.
  - **Cost Considerations:**
    - Initial infrastructure costs for MVP (development/staging/initial production environments) must not exceed **$50 per month**.
    - Cloud infrastructure costs (Vercel, Supabase, LLM APIs, Notifications) should be monitored monthly and maintained within **10-15%** of the product's revenue (post-monetization, if applicable).
