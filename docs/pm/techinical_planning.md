# Product Design System Document: Technical Planning (Component Level)

---

## Component Overview

This document outlines the structure and guidelines for **Technical Planning at
the Component Level**. This is an engineering-driven artifact focusing on the
detailed design, chosen approaches, and strategic considerations for specific
core technical modules or services within the larger system. It translates
high-level architectural decisions into actionable engineering blueprints, often
involving research and exploration of viable solutions.

### Purpose of this Component (`technical_planning.md`)

This file provides the **template and guidelines** for **AI Software Engineer
Agents (and human engineers)** to create robust, well-researched, and detailed
design documents for individual technical components (e.g., Authentication
Service, Data Ingestion Pipeline, Search Module, LLM Prompt Management, RAG
System, Web Interface). This ensures that critical engineering decisions are
thoroughly considered, documented, and aligned with overall product and system
goals.

### How this Component Fits in the Workflow

- **Upstream Dependencies:**
  - `High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions`: Provides the
    overarching architectural vision, chosen technologies, and system-wide
    non-functional requirements. This document elaborates on specific parts of
    that high-level design.
  - `Product Concept & Core Requirements`: Component planning must ensure the
    chosen technical approaches can fulfill product functionality and user
    experience goals.
  - `Problem & Opportunity Definition`: Underlying problems and business
    outcomes must always be kept in mind, as component design directly impacts
    the system's ability to solve these.
- **Downstream Impact:**
  - These detailed component planning documents serve as the primary input for
    the low-level implementation by AI Development Agents or human engineers.
  - They inform the creation of new foundational or functional tasks (which
    would then be captured by a re-run of `docs/technical_planning.md` - the one
    we defined previously for task _identification_ - but that's a future
    iteration of the workflow).
  - They become part of the living `artifacts/` for engineering reference and
    ongoing maintenance.
  - **Crucially, they contribute to the `artifacts/technical_planning/index.md`
    which provides a compositional view of the system's technical modules.**

## AI Software Engineer Agent Guidelines for this Component

As an AI Software Engineer Agent (or human engineer) responsible for technical
planning, my instructions for managing this document are:

- **Module Ownership:** Take full ownership of the designated technical
  component. Understand its boundaries, its inputs, and its expected outputs.
- **Research & Exploration:** Do not simply pick the first solution. Conduct
  thorough research into alternative approaches, technologies, and patterns.
  Evaluate pros, cons, and their implications for scalability, maintainability,
  cost, and security.
- **Rationale-Driven Decisions:** For every significant design choice or
  recommended approach, clearly articulate the "why." Back decisions with data,
  research findings, and alignment with the high-level technical design and
  non-functional requirements.
- **Addressing NFRs (Component-Specific):** Explicitly detail how this component
  contributes to meeting system-wide Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., how this
  caching solution directly impacts the 2-second load time goal).
- **Clarity for Implementation:** The document should serve as a clear,
  unambiguous blueprint for engineers implementing the component. Include
  diagrams, code snippets (if illustrating a core pattern), and data models
  where necessary.
- **Identifying Open Questions/Risks:** Proactively identify and document any
  remaining open questions, known limitations, key decision points for human
  review, or potential technical risks associated with the component's design.
- **Compositional View Maintenance:** After creating or updating a component's
  technical planning document, **always update the
  `artifacts/technical_planning/index.md` file.** Add a new entry for the
  component and, if applicable, update any sections describing its interaction
  with other modules or the overall system composition.

### Validation Strategy for this Component

Before marking this component's `Technical Planning` document as complete, I
must perform the following validation checks:

- **Upstream Alignment:**
  - Verify that the component's design adheres to the overarching
    `Architectural Pattern` and `Key Technology & Tooling Choices` defined in
    `High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions`.
  - Confirm that the component can fulfill its part of the
    `Product Feature Specifications` that rely on it.
  - Ensure non-functional considerations for this component align with
    system-wide `Non-Functional Requirements`.
- **Completeness & Detail:**
  - Confirm all sections (1 to 7) are fully populated with sufficient detail for
    a downstream engineer to begin implementation.
  - Ensure all options considered and rationales are clearly articulated.
- **Feasibility & Pragmatism:**
  - Assess if the proposed solution is technically feasible within known
    constraints (e.g., timeline, resources) and is not overly complex for the
    problem it solves.
- **Clarity & Understandability:**
  - Is the document easy to understand for another engineer? Are diagrams clear?
    Is terminology consistent?
- **Risk & Open Question Disclosure:**
  - Are all known limitations, trade-offs, and open questions clearly documented
    for review?
- **Compositional Map Update:**
  - **Verify that `artifacts/technical_planning/index.md` has been updated to
    include this component and reflect its place in the system composition.**
- **Human Review Flagging:**
  - If critical design decisions require human architectural review, stakeholder
    input, or if there are unmitigated high risks, flag the document for human
    review with specific observations and queries.

## Artifact Definition: Technical Planning Document (Component Specific)

This section defines the content structure for an **Engineering-Led Technical
Planning Document** for a specific core component. These documents will be
generated by AI Software Engineer Agents (or human engineers) and stored as
artifacts.

### Artifact Storage Location:

`artifacts/technical_planning/[COMPONENT_NAME].md` (e.g.,
`artifacts/technical_planning/authentication_service.md`,
`artifacts/technical_planning/rag_module.md`)

### Artifact Structure & Content Requirements:

- All bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) within the artifact MUST be populated with
  specific, relevant information.
- All AI Software Engineer Agent Guidelines within this template are for the
  engineering agent's internal process and should NOT be included in the final
  generated artifact.
