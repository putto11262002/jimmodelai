# Product Design System Document: High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions

---

## Component Overview

This document outlines the **High-Level Technical Design & Architectural
Decisions** component of our Product Design System. It defines the overall
technical blueprint for the solution, translating product concepts into a
strategic technical approach.

### Purpose of this Component (`technical_design.md`)

This file provides the **template and guidelines** for the AI Agent to define
the **system architecture, chosen technologies, non-functional requirements, and
key architectural decisions** for an initiative. It acts as the blueprint for
creating the corresponding artifact in the `artifacts/technical_design/`
directory.

### How this Component Fits in the Workflow

- **Upstream Dependencies:** This component **directly builds upon the
  `Product Concept & Core Requirements`** artifact. The technical design must
  enable the solution vision, core user journeys, and MVP scope defined
  upstream. It also implicitly draws from the
  `Problem & Opportunity Definition`.
- **Downstream Impact:** This component establishes the foundation for all
  subsequent technical work. It directly informs:
  - `Technical Planning (Component Level)`: For detailed design of individual
    technical components.
  - `Product Feature Specifications`: To ensure technical feasibility and guide
    implementation details.
  - `Task Scoping & Construction`: For defining engineering tasks.

## Guidance for AI Agent: High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions (The "HOW-TO")

This section provides specific instructions and methodologies for the AI Agent
when assisting in the creation of the High-Level Technical Design artifact. The
agent MUST strictly adhere to these guidelines, applying its core operational
rules (defined in `docs/pm/index.md`) contextually here.

### Agent & Human Collaboration Behavior for High-Level Technical Design

- **Principle:** The agent should guide the human user (potentially a technical
  lead) through a structured process of outlining the technical solution,
  ensuring alignment with product goals, while facilitating strategic
  architectural decisions and considering non-functional requirements.
- **Sequential Progression & Confirmation:**
  - The definition process should generally follow the artifact sections
    sequentially.
  - The **Agent MUST obtain explicit human confirmation** after sufficient
    clarity and content are achieved for each major section before proceeding.
- **Proactive Contribution (Challenge & Suggestion):**
  - The agent is empowered to **proactively challenge** technical approaches
    that seem to contradict the product concept, violate non-functional
    requirements, or introduce undue complexity/risk. Challenges must be
    accompanied by a clear _rationale_.
  - The agent **MAY proactively suggest** common architectural patterns,
    technology choices, or alternative design considerations based on best
    practices and potential implications for scalability, security, or
    maintenance. **Crucially, these suggestions should be research-based,
    derived from an assumed ability to access and interpret current technical
    knowledge, best practices, and industry trends (as if using research
    tools/knowledge bases).** Suggestions must be presented with their rationale
    and potential benefit.
- **Flagging for Human Review (Escalation):** The agent **MUST flag for explicit
  human review** (as per the Critical Review Flagging directive in its core
  prompt) if:
  - Significant architectural decisions require deep human expertise in specific
    domains or technologies beyond the scope of general technical knowledge.
  - Contradictions arise between proposed technical design and product
    requirements that cannot be resolved through iterative refinement.
  - Unacceptable risks (e.g., security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks)
    are identified that lack clear mitigation strategies.

### Specific Agent Elicitation Techniques & Frameworks for High-Level Technical Design

This section details the methodologies to be applied by the AI agent for
structured elicitation to populate each section of the artifact.

_(To be detailed later, e.g., using frameworks for architecture decision
records, threat modeling, or technology selection matrices. For now, this serves
as a placeholder to indicate where this guidance will live.)_

## Validation Strategy for this Component (for AI Agent)

As the AI Agent, before marking this component's artifact as complete, you must
perform the following validation checks:

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Confirm all sections and their sub-components are fully populated.
  - Verify that no bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) remain in the generated
    artifact.
- **Consistency & Cohesion Check (with Upstream):**
  - **Concept-Design Alignment:** Ensure the technical design directly enables
    the solution vision, user journeys, and MVP scope defined in the upstream
    `Product Concept & Core Requirements` artifact.
  - **Problem-Design Alignment:** Verify that core technical decisions
    indirectly (via product concept) support addressing the original problem
    defined upstream.
- **Logical Flow Check:**
  - Read through the entire generated artifact to ensure a coherent narrative
    from high-level architecture down to key decisions and non-functional
    requirements.
- **Proactive Challenge on Inconsistency:** If any ambiguities or
  inconsistencies are detected during validation that cannot be resolved
  automatically, the agent MUST proactively challenge the user/data, provide
  rationale, and if unresolved, **flag the artifact for human review** with
  specific observations and suggested questions.

## Artifact Definition: High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions Artifact

This section defines the content structure for the **High-Level Technical Design
& Architectural Decisions Artifact** that will be generated and managed by the
AI Agent.

### Artifact Storage Location:

`artifacts/technical_design/doc.md`

### Artifact Structure & Content Requirements:

- All bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) within the artifact MUST be populated with
  specific, relevant information.
- All `AI Agent Guideline` comments within the template are for the AI Agent's
  internal process and should **NOT** be included in the final generated
  artifact.

### 3.1 Architectural Overview

- **Purpose:** To provide a high-level conceptual view of the system's
  architecture, its main components, and their interactions.
- **Content:**
  - **System Context:** [Briefly describe the overall system and its boundaries
    in relation to external systems or users.]
  - **Core Components:** [List and briefly describe the main logical components
    or services that will constitute the system (e.g., API Gateway, User
    Service, Data Storage, ML Model Service).]
  - **High-Level Interactions:** [Describe how these core components will
    generally interact with each other (e.g., API Gateway routes requests to
    services, services interact with data storage).]
  - **Architectural Diagram (Conceptual):** [Placeholder for a conceptual
    diagram (e.g., block diagram, C4 Model Level 1) - to be referenced from
    `artifacts/assets/`.]
    - `[Example: assets/diagrams/conceptual_architecture.png]`

### 3.2 Key Architectural Decisions

- **Purpose:** To document significant technical decisions, along with their
  rationale, implications, and alternatives considered.
- **Content:**
  - **Decision 1: [Short, descriptive title of the decision, e.g., "Choice of
    Database for User Data"]**
    - `Decision`: [The specific technical choice made (e.g., "PostgreSQL will be
      used for user metadata").]
    - `Rationale`: [The primary reasons for this choice (e.g., "Strong ACID
      compliance needed for transactional data, existing team expertise").]
    - `Alternatives Considered`: [Briefly list other options and why they were
      not chosen (e.g., "NoSQL considered for flexibility but lacked transaction
      guarantees").]
    - `Implications`: [Consequences of this decision (e.g., "Requires database
      administration, enables complex querying").]
  - **Decision 2: [Another key decision]**
    - `Decision`: ...
    - `Rationale`: ...
    - `Alternatives Considered`: ...
    - `Implications`: ...

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Purpose:** To define the quality attributes and constraints that the system
  must meet, crucial for successful delivery but not directly related to core
  functionality.
- **Content:**
  - **Performance:** [e.g., "All user-facing APIs must respond within 200ms for
    95% of requests."]
  - **Scalability:** [e.g., "The system must support 100,000 concurrent users
    without degradation."]
  - **Security:** [e.g., "All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in
    transit; adhering to OWASP Top 10."]
  - **Reliability/Availability:** [e.g., "System must have 99.9% uptime (24/7);
    RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour."]
  - **Maintainability:** [e.g., "Codebase must be well-documented and follow
    clean architecture principles, allowing new features to be added within X
    days."]
  - **Cost Considerations:** [e.g., "Project's infrastructure costs must not
    exceed $Y per month for Z active users."]
