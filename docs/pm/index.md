### Introduction: The AI-Augmented Product Design System

This is the central guide for our Product Design System. This system is
engineered to streamline and enhance product design and specification through
intelligent automation and modular documentation.

This collaborative ecosystem's **overall objective** is to transform nascent
ideas into **clear, actionable design artifacts and technical specifications**
that serve as direct context and instruction for both AI Development Agents and
human engineering teams, ensuring efficient and accurate implementation.

It achieves this by:

- **Integrating Human Expertise with AI Efficiency:** Seamlessly blending
  strategic human oversight and decision-making with the speed, analysis
  capabilities, and generative power of adaptable AI agents.
- **Ensuring Continuous Context & Alignment:** Maintaining a single source of
  truth for all product design elements, fostering clarity, reducing ambiguity,
  and insuring all stakeholders operate from the most current and relevant
  information.
- **Enabling Iterative & Agile Development:** Supporting flexible workflows
  where individual design components can evolve and be refined independently,
  reflecting the dynamic nature of product development.

### Operational Model: Human & AI Roles

This system operates on a fundamental division of labor, clearly defining roles
and responsibilities among its key stakeholders.

- **Human Product Lead (You):**
  - **Strategic Vision, Direction & Approval:** Defines overarching product
    strategy, business goals, and validates key design and technical decisions.
  - **Contextual Nuance & Intuition:** Provides critical insights, user empathy,
    and market understanding, especially for subjective or complex scenarios.
  - **Accountability:** Bears ultimate responsibility for the product's success
    and the integrity of the design artifacts.
- **AI Product Manager Agents:**
  - **System Orchestration & Guidance:** Manages the overall documentation
    structure, ensures adherence to guidelines, and facilitates navigation by
    applying core operational principles (as defined in the primary agent
    prompt).
  - **Structured Elicitation & Content Generation:** Drafts, elaborates, and
    refines detailed specifications based on human input and specific `docs/`
    guidelines, proactively challenging inconsistencies and suggesting
    alternatives.
  - **Analysis & Validation:** Cross-references proposals, identifies gaps, and
    seeks clarification, ensuring logical consistency within artifacts and
    across the system.
- **AI Development Agents:**
  - **Consumers of Artifacts:** Will consume the detailed specifications and
    guidelines generated by AI PM Agents to produce robust code and carry out
    implementation tasks.
- **Human Engineering Teams:**
  - **Consumers of Artifacts:** Will consume the detailed specifications and
    guidelines for development, review, and integration, collaborating with AI
    Development Agents.

### System Structure & Data Flow: A Mental Model for Navigation

This Product Design System is organized as a repository where documentation is
**componentized**, establishing a clear **hierarchical flow of information**.
Think of it as a set of interconnected knowledge domains, where foundational
components inform and govern those built upon them.

- **`docs/` Directory (Meta-Documentation Layer):**
  - **Purpose:** Contains the **guidelines and templates** that instruct AI
    Agents on _how_ to generate content. This is the manual for _how_ to use the
    system and _how_ the agents operate, including specific methodologies and
    human-in-the-loop protocols for each artifact.
  - **Key Content:** Specific artifact templates, operational directives for
    agent behavior, and system architecture details.
- **`artifacts/` Directory (Product Definition Layer):**
  - **Purpose:** Contains the **actual, living design artifacts and
    specifications** generated by the AI Agents, based on the `docs/` guidelines
    and human input. These are the executable specifications for development.

**Navigating the System Files:**

- **How do we _build_ the documentation? (The processes, policies, agent
  instructions):** Look in `docs/`
- **What _is_ the documentation (the actual product specification)? (The data,
  designs, and tasks):** Look in `artifacts/`

### Product Design System Components

This system is composed of several key documentation components, each serving a
distinct purpose and building upon the previous stages. For detailed guidelines
and generated artifacts, refer to the respective `docs/` and `artifacts/`
locations.

#### Problem & Opportunity Definition

- **Purpose:** To define the core problem, target audience, business outcomes,
  and strategic alignment for the product. Itâ€™s the foundational "why" and "what
  problem."
- **Relationship:** The absolute starting point. All subsequent decisions must
  align with the problems defined here.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/problem_definition.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/problem_definition/`

#### Product Concept & Core Requirements

- **Purpose:** To articulate the high-level solution vision, core user journeys,
  and the minimum viable product (MVP) scope. It outlines the high-level "what
  we are building."
- **Relationship:** Directly builds upon the Problem & Opportunity Definition.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/product_concept_requirements.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/product_concept_requirements/`

#### High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions

- **Purpose:** To define the overall technical blueprint, including chosen
  technologies, high-level architecture, infrastructure strategy, and
  non-functional requirements. It answers "how we will technically build it"
  from a strategic perspective.
- **Relationship:** Translates product requirements into a technical strategy.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/technical_design.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/technical_design/`

#### Product Feature Specifications

- **Purpose:** To provide granular, user-centric details for each individual
  feature, including user stories, functional requirements, and precise
  acceptance criteria, organized by Epic. This forms the detailed "what,
  exactly" for implementation.
- **Relationship:** Derived from the MVP Scope and user flows in Product Concept
  & Core Requirements. It is a primary input for task generation.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/product_feature_specifications.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/product_features/`

#### Technical Planning (Component Level)

- **Purpose:** To provide guidelines for engineering-driven detailed design,
  research, and planning for specific core technical components. This is where
  architectural pieces are deeply defined and documented.
- **Relationship:** Draws heavily from High-Level Technical Design to elaborate
  on specific architectural elements. It is an essential input for task
  generation.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/technical_planning.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/technical_planning/`

#### Task Scoping & Construction

- **Purpose:** To systematically identify and consolidate _all_ required tasks
  (functional, foundational, non-functional, research, etc.) by analyzing both
  `Product Feature Specifications` AND the detailed insights from
  `Technical Planning (Component Level)` artifacts. It then structures these
  tasks for external task management systems.
- **Relationship:** Takes unified inputs from `Product Feature Specifications`
  and `Technical Planning (Component Level)` to generate a comprehensive,
  structured list of tasks.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/task_scoping.md`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/generated_tasks/`

#### Assets & Supplementary Materials

- **Purpose:** To organize all non-textual design artifacts such as diagrams,
  mockups, prototypes, and other visual aids that complement the written
  specifications.
- **Relationship:** These assets are referenced directly within the
  specification markdown files across all components, providing essential visual
  context.
- **Guidelines:** `docs/pm/assets/`
- **Living Artifacts Location:** `artifacts/assets/`

### Data Consistency & Validation

Maintaining data consistency and ensuring artifact validation is paramount for
the system's integrity and the success of product development. All AI agents
adhere to strict protocols for this:

- **Guideline Adherence:** AI agents strictly **adhere to the guidelines located
  in the `docs/` directory** for format and content generation.
- **Hierarchical Validation:** Agents **validate artifacts against upstream
  dependencies** to ensure logical consistency and flow.
- **Impact Revalidation:** Changes to a component trigger **re-evaluation of
  impact both up and down the documentation hierarchy**.
- **AI-Driven Internal Consistency Checks:** Agents employ a **"Low Tolerance
  for Ambiguity and Internal Inconsistency"** to identify and flag issues.
- **Human Review Flagging:** For unresolvable issues requiring intuition or
  external input, agents **explicitly flag the situation for human review**.
