# Product Design System Document: Product Feature Specifications

---

## Component Overview

This document outlines the **Product Feature Specifications** component. It
provides granular, user-centric details for each individual feature, including
user stories, functional requirements, and precise acceptance criteria. These
features are organized under a higher-level **Epic** to maintain strategic
alignment. This forms the detailed "what, exactly" for implementation for both
AI and human engineering agents.

### Purpose of this Component (`product_feature_specifications.md`)

This file provides the **template and guidelines** for the AI Product Manager
(me) to break down high-level product concepts into actionable, detailed feature
specifications, organized by their overarching Epic. It acts as the blueprint
for creating the corresponding `Product Feature Specification Artifact(s)` in
the `artifacts/` directory.

### How this Component Fits in the Workflow

- **Upstream Dependencies:** Directly dependent on the
  `Product Concept & Core Requirements` component, specifically the "Core
  Idea/Vision," "MVP Scope," and "Core User Flows / Journeys." The Epics defined
  here should align with the strategic objectives and high-level scope
  established upstream. It implicitly leverages the
  `Problem & Opportunity Definition` for the underlying "why."
- **Downstream Impact:** This component is a primary input for
  `Technical Planning` (which synthesizes all tasks). It also informs any direct
  references in `Task Scoping & Construction`. Awareness of
  `High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions` is also required to
  ensure features are defined with practical feasibility in mind without
  dictating implementation.

## AI PM Agent Guidelines for this Component

As the AI PM Agent, my instructions for managing this component are:

- **Contextual Mandate:** Thoroughly review the
  `Product Concept & Core Requirements` artifact to ensure each Epic and its
  contained features align with the overall vision, user flows, and MVP scope.
  Reference the `Problem & Opportunity Definition` for the core problem being
  solved by each Epic and feature.
- **Epic Definition:** Define Epics as large bodies of work that have a common
  strategic objective or theme, often spanning multiple features or iterations.
  Each Epic should contribute to a key business outcome.
- **User-Centric Detailing:** Always frame features and user stories from the
  perspective of the target user, using the "As a [User Role], I want to
  [Action], so that [Benefit]" user story format.
- **Precision & Testability:** Ensure all functional requirements are explicit
  and unambiguous. Acceptance Criteria must be precise, measurable, and directly
  testable by both automated processes (e.g., AI testing agents) and human QA.
- **Minimizing Ambiguity:** Avoid vague terms. If clarity is difficult due to
  complexity, suggest further breaking down the feature or flagging for human
  discussion.
- **Alignment with Technical Context:** While not a deep technical spec, be
  mindful of the high-level technical decisions (from `technical_design.md`) to
  ensure features are defined with practical feasibility in mind without
  dictating implementation.

### Validation Strategy for this Component

Before marking this component's artifact(s) as complete, I must perform the
following validation checks:

- **Upstream Alignment Check:**
  - Verify that each "Epic" aligns with a strategic goal or significant
    initiative from `Problem & Opportunity Definition` or
    `Product Concept & Core Requirements`.
  - Ensure each "Feature Name" and "User Story" within an Epic directly
    corresponds to a feature listed in the "In-Scope for MVP" section of
    `Product Concept & Core Requirements`.
  - Ensure the "User Role" in each user story is defined in the
    `Problem & Opportunity Definition`.
- **Completeness Check:**
  - Confirm all required fields (Epic, Feature, User Story, Functional
    Requirements, Acceptance Criteria) are populated for each definition.
  - Verify that no bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) remain in the generated
    artifact(s).
- **Precision & Testability Check:**
  - For each Acceptance Criterion, confirm it follows a clear "Given-When-Then"
    structure or an equivalent explicit testable pattern.
  - Ensure each Acceptance Criterion is specific enough that an AI or human
    could unambiguously determine if it's met.
- **Coverage Check:**
  - Cross-reference against the "Core User Flows / Journeys" from
    `Product Concept & Core Requirements` to ensure all key steps and alternate
    paths are adequately supported by functional requirements and acceptance
    criteria across the defined features within Epics.
- **Atomic vs. Epic/Feature Check:**
  - Assess if any single feature is too large and should be broken into multiple
    features within an Epic.
  - Assess if a user story is too large or complex; if it contains multiple
    distinct user goals, suggest breaking it down into smaller, more atomic user
    stories.
- **Human Review Flagging:**
  - If critical ambiguities, conflicting requirements, or unresolvable gaps in
    the user journey persist despite internal validation, flag the artifact for
    human review with specific observations and queries.

## Artifact Definition: Product Feature Specification Artifact

This section defines the content structure for the **Product Feature
Specification Artifact(s)** that will be generated and managed by the AI PM
Agent. Each major Epic, or sub-product, might be a separate artifact for better
modularity.

### Artifact Storage Location:

`artifacts/product_features/[PRODUCT_OR_EPIC_NAME]/[FEATURE_NAME].md` (Multiple
files under a feature-specific subdirectory may be used for better organization)

### Artifact Structure & Content Requirements:

- All bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) within the artifact MUST be populated with
  specific, relevant information.
- All AI PM Agent Guideline comments within the template are for the AI PM's
  internal process and should NOT be included in the final generated artifact.

### **Epic: [Epic Name]**

- **Purpose:** To group a collection of related features under a common
  strategic objective or a significant body of work. Epics provide a
  higher-level organizational unit for product planning and roadmapping.
- **Content:**

  - **Epic ID:** [A unique identifier for this Epic, e.g.,
    `EPIC-CUSTOMER-ONBOARDING`]
  - **Epic Goal:** [A brief statement of the high-level goal this Epic aims to
    achieve, linking it to the Problem & Opportunity Definition (e.g., "Simplify
    customer onboarding to reduce churn").]
