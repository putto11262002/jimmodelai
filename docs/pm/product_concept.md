# Product Design System Document: Product Concept & Core Requirements

---

## Component Overview

This document outlines the **Product Concept & Core Requirements** component of
our Product Design System. It translates the validated problem into a high-level
solution vision, defining the core product concept, key user journeys, and the
minimum viable product (MVP) scope.

### Purpose of this Component (`product_concept_requirements.md`)

This file provides the **template and guidelines** for the AI Agent to define
the **overall high-level solution, user journeys, key features, and MVP
scoping** for an initiative. It acts as the blueprint for creating the
corresponding `Product Concept & Core Requirements Artifact` in the `artifacts/`
directory.

### How this Component Fits in the Workflow

- **Upstream Dependencies:** This component **directly builds upon the
  `Problem & Opportunity Definition`** artifact. The solution concepts defined
  here must directly address the problems, target audience pains, and desired
  business outcomes from the upstream `artifacts/problem_definition/` files.
- **Downstream Impact:** This component provides the foundational product vision
  for more detailed specification. It directly informs:
  - `Product Feature Specifications`: For detailed feature breakdown.
  - `High-Level Technical Design & Architectural Decisions`: For technical
    strategy.
  - `Technical Planning`: For component-level technical details.

## Guidance for AI Agent: Product Concept & Core Requirements (The "HOW-TO")

This section provides specific instructions and methodologies for the AI Agent
when assisting in the creation of the Product Concept & Core Requirements
artifact. The agent MUST strictly adhere to these guidelines, applying its core
operational rules (defined in `docs/pm/index.md`) contextually here.

### Agent & Human Collaboration Behavior for Product Concept & Core Requirements

- **Principle:** The agent should guide the human user through an iterative
  process of ideation and scoping, ensuring the proposed solution aligns with
  the validated problem, while maintaining flexibility for exploration and
  strategic decision-making by the human.
- **Sequential Progression & Confirmation:**
  - The definition process should generally follow the artifact sections
    sequentially.
  - The **Agent MUST obtain explicit human confirmation** after sufficient
    clarity and content are achieved for each major section before proceeding.
- **Proactive Contribution (Challenge & Suggestion):**
  - The agent is empowered to **proactively challenge** misalignment between the
    proposed concept and the upstream `Problem & Opportunity Definition`.
    Challenges must be accompanied by rationale.
  - The agent **MAY proactively suggest** alternative solution approaches, user
    journeys, or scoping decisions to prompt creative thinking or efficiently
    address problem areas. Suggestions must be presented with their rationale
    and potential benefit.
- **Flagging for Human Review (Escalation):** The agent **MUST flag for explicit
  human review** (as per the Critical Review Flagging directive in its core
  prompt) if:
  - Significant deviations or inconsistencies arise between the proposed concept
    and the upstream `Problem & Opportunity Definition` that cannot be
    reconciled.
  - The scope becomes unmanageable or contradicts stated MVP goals.
  - Critical decisions require external input on user experience, market fit, or
    business strategy not derivable through logical deduction.

### Specific Agent Elicitation Techniques & Frameworks for Product Concept & Core Requirements

This section details the methodologies to be applied by the AI agent for
structured elicitation to populate each section of the artifact.

_(To be detailed later, e.g., using frameworks for solution sketching, user
story mapping, or MVP definition. For now, this serves as a placeholder to
indicate where this guidance will live.)_

## Validation Strategy for this Component (for AI Agent)

As the AI Agent, before marking this component's artifact as complete, you must
perform the following validation checks:

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Confirm all sections and their sub-components are fully populated.
  - Verify that no bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) remain in the generated
    artifact.
- **Consistency & Cohesion Check (with Upstream):**
  - **Problem-Solution Alignment:** Ensure the proposed solution(s) directly and
    effectively address the problem(s), target audience pain points, and desired
    business outcomes defined in the upstream `Problem & Opportunity Definition`
    artifact.
  - **Journey-Concept Alignment:** Validate that core user journeys naturally
    flow from the high-level solution concept.
- **Logical Flow Check:**
  - Read through the entire generated artifact to ensure a coherent narrative
    from problem (implied from upstream) to proposed solution and initial scope.
- **Proactive Challenge on Inconsistency:** If any ambiguities or
  inconsistencies are detected during validation that cannot be resolved
  automatically, the agent MUST proactively challenge the user/data, provide
  rationale, and if unresolved, **flag the artifact for human review** with
  specific observations and suggested questions.

## Artifact Definition: Product Concept & Core Requirements Artifact

This section defines the content structure for the **Product Concept & Core
Requirements Artifact** that will be generated and managed by the AI Agent.

### Artifact Storage Location:

`artifacts/product_concept_requirements/[PRODUCT_OR_FEATURE_NAME].md`

### Artifact Structure & Content Requirements:

- All bracketed placeholders (`[ ]`) within the artifact MUST be populated with
  specific, relevant information.
- All `AI Agent Guideline` comments within the template are for the AI Agent's
  internal process and should **NOT** be included in the final generated
  artifact.

### 2.1 Solution Overview

- **Purpose:** To describe the high-level vision of the product or feature that
  will address the problem defined in the Problem & Opportunity Definition.
- **Content:**
  - **Concept Summary:** [A concise, high-level description of the proposed
    solution. What is it, and what does it generally enable users to do?]
    - `[Example - A new mobile app feature that provides real-time X for Y users]`
  - **Key Value Proposition:** [What unique value will this solution deliver to
    the target audience beyond simply solving the problem? Why choose this
    solution?]
    - `[Example - Enables users to save X hours per week, provides Y competitive advantage]`

---

### 2.2 Core User Journeys

- **Purpose:** To illustrate the primary paths a user will take to achieve their
  goals within the solution.
- **Content:**
  - **Journey 1: [Journey Title (e.g., Onboarding, Core Task Completion,
    Reporting)]**
    - `User Goal`: [What the user aims to achieve in this journey.]
    - `Steps`: [Brief, high-level sequential steps a user takes to complete the
      goal within the new solution. Focus on user actions and system responses
      where relevant.]
      - `[Step 1: User does X]`
      - `[Step 2: System responds with Y]`
      - `...`
  - **Journey 2: [Another Journey Title (if applicable)]**
    - `User Goal`: ...
    - `Steps`: ...

### 2.3 Key Features & Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

- **Purpose:** To define the essential features required for the first iteration
  (MVP) of the product that will deliver core value and validate the solution
  concept.
- **Content:**
  - **MVP Definition:** [A clear statement on what constitutes the MVP for this
    initiative. What is the absolute minimum feature set required to address the
    core problem and deliver the key value proposition?]
  - **MVP Features:**
    - `Feature 1`: [Brief, descriptive name of an MVP feature.]
    - `Description`: [High-level functional description of the feature and how
      it contributes to solving the problem or delivering value. Link to user
      journeys.]
    - `Contribution to MVP`: [Why is this feature absolutely essential for the
      MVP?]
  - **Out-of-Scope for MVP (but potential future features):**
    - `Future Feature 1`: [Brief name of a feature explicitly not in MVP.]
    - `Rationale`: [Why this feature is not included in the MVP (e.g.,
      complexity, not critical for validation, dependent on MVP success).]
